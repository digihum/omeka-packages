## Usage

Use this as a compser package repository that provides composer.json representations for omeka plugins that don't have one within the repository. The URL is `https://digihum.github.io/omeka-packages/`. This can be added to a composer.json file.

```        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://digihum.github.io/omeka-packages/",
        },
```
